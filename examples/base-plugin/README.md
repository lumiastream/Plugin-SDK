# Base Plugin Template

Internal template used by the SDK CLI to scaffold new plugins. It includes every manifest field and a minimal implementation that logs lifecycle events.

Most users should run `npm run create:plugin -- ./my-plugin`, which copies this template and customises IDs and names for you.
