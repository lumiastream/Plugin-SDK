# Showcase Plugin Template

This template demonstrates a minimal, production-friendly Lumia Stream plugin workflow:

- Defines a small set of settings with a short setup tutorial
- Exposes a single action that triggers an alert
- Updates a few variables that alerts and other Lumia features can use
- Keeps logging to errors only

Use the CLI to copy and customize the template:

```
npx lumia-plugin create my_plugin
```

After scaffolding you can tailor the manifest, code, and README to match your idea.
