1) Open **OpenRGB** and enable the **SDK Server**.
2) Confirm host/port (default `127.0.0.1:6742`).
3) Save these settings in Lumia and activate the plugin.
4) Use **Discover OpenRGB Devices** to import devices as selectable lights.

### Notes
- On remote hosts, allow incoming TCP to the OpenRGB SDK port.
- Some devices require a direct/custom mode before color writes. This plugin automatically attempts that.
