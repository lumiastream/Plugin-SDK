# Basic Logger Plugin (Example)

A minimal plugin that demonstrates the `Plugin` lifecycle and a single custom action. Use it as a starting point or as a sanity check that your SDK setup is working.

## Actions

- **log_message** – writes the provided message to the Lumia log panel. The action is defined in `manifest.json` and handled in `main.js`.

## Usage

1. Copy the directory into your Lumia plugins folder (or use **Load from Directory**).
2. Trigger the **Log Message** action from the plugin UI or automations to confirm logs appear in Lumia.
